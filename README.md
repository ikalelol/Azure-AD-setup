# Active Directory in Azure Virtual Machines

This repository documents the process of setting up and managing an Active Directory (AD) environment within Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). This project is a step-by-step guide, including screenshots and insights based on personal experience.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Centralize domain and user management using Active Directory.
- **Environment**: Azure VMs with Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Microsoft Azure
  - Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  - PowerShell

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Azure Resources
#### Domain Controller (DC)
- Create a Windows Server 2022 Datacenter VM.
- Admin credentials:
  ```
  Username: kaleadmin
  Password: NoTSecU3rPa$
  ```
- Use default settings.

#### Client VM
- Create a Windows 10 VM in the same resource group and virtual network (VNet) as the DC.

### 2. Network Configuration
- Assign a static private IP to the Domain Controller for consistent connectivity.

- Ensure both VMs are in the same VNet and subnet.

### 3. Accessing the Server
- Use RDP from a local machine (Windows 10/11) with the Azure-assigned public IP or download the RDP file.

### 4. Install Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)
- Open **Server Manager** and add the ADDS role via **Add Roles and Features**.
- Add Roles and Features

- Promote the server to a Domain Controller:
  - Click the notification flag (top-right corner).
  - Configure a new forest (e.g., `gitkale.com`).
  - Use default settings.

### 5. Create Users and Organizational Units (OUs)
- Open **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.
- Create:
  - OUs: `_Admins`, `_Employees`
  - Users:
    - `Kale_Admin` (Domain Admins group)
    - `Kale` (normal user)

### 6. Join Client VM to the Domain
- Verify both VMs are in the same VNet and subnet.

- From the Client VM:
  - Login via RDP.
  - Navigate to **System > Rename This PC (Advanced)**.
  - Change the domain to `gitkale.com`.

- Restart the Client VM, reconnect, and log in with domain accounts.

### 7. Additional Configuration
- Create additional users using [this PowerShell script](https://github.com/Xinloiazn/configure-ad/blob/main/adscript.ps1.
- Set up Group Policy Objects (GPOs):
  - Restrict disabling the firewall and antivirus.
  - Disable auto-run from USB devices.

## Tips and Insights
- **Segregation of Duties**: Use separate accounts for administrative tasks (`Kale_Admin`) and everyday use (`Kale`).
- **Cleanup**: Delete Azure resources after testing to avoid unnecessary charges.
